The `.user.js` scripts in this folder can be added to the webbrowser using the extension tampermonkey.

TamperMonkey is available from their homepage ([tampermonkey.net](https://www.tampermonkey.net/))

Footnote: Scripts can be installed directly from GitHub _after_ [this script](https://github.com/jesus2099/konami-command/raw/master/INSTALL-USER-SCRIPT.user.js) has been installed.
